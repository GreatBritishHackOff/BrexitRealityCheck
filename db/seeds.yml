- title: Jobs / unemployment
  body:
    Which of the following three is closest to how you feel about jobs?
  answers:
    - I dont think Britain being in the EU has had a detrimental
      effect on employment in the UK
    - Some control of movement is necessary to protect British jobs
    - I think leaving the EU is essential to protect British jobs

- title: Prices
  answers:
    - I think the cost of living will be lower if we stay in the EU
    - Some short term increases in prices are worth the benefits of a
      soft Brexit and the economy should soon bounce back.
    - Rising prices is a small price to pay for regaining our sovereignty.
  extra:
    By that way did you know that when we voted to leave the EU the
    British pound fell 20% in value, making all our imports more expensive
    and pushing up the cost of living.

- title: NHS
  answers:
    - I think the long term future of the NHS is safer if we stay
      in the EU because of continued access to a workforce and EU funding
      and partnerships
    - One of things I want to see if us take control over who has access
      to our NHS
    - The NHS should be for British people only. Let's ban health tourism.

- title: Education
  answers:
    - I want my children to have access to lower cost and/or higher quality
      education available in Europe.
    - I think there is enough pressure on our education system, without having
      to worry about foreign students.
    - Our education system should only be for British kids and we should get
      rid of all foreign language classes.
  extra:
    The EU posed no restrictions on our education system.

- title: Control over UK laws
  answers:
    - I am scared about the deregulation that could follow leaving the EU
      and am confident in the current moderating effects on being in the EU.
    - Let's get rid of silly EU bureaucracy and red tape.
    - We need to take back control of all our laws and judicial system!

- title: Policing
  answers:
    - I would feel safer if we remained in the EU and continued to enjoy
      cross border cooperation of our police forces.
    - Even if we leave, it’s in the EU's interest to continue cooperating
      with our police force.
    - We will be able to deal better with policing if we have a free hand in it.

- title: Taxes
  answers:
    - Remaining in the EU is a key part of seeing taxation become more fair,
      with new European legislation which will curtain tax avoidance.
    - I think Britain should be able to control its own taxation.
    - It’s absurd that faceless bureaucrats in Brussels can control the
      taxation rates in my country.

- title: Defence
  answers:
    - Greater cooperation between states increases our domestic security.
    - I would like to see Britain have full control of its own defence.
    - Being in the EU does nothing for our defence, since we would remain in
      NATO regardless of Brexit.
